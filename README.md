# dance-actions üíÉüï∫ü§∏‚Äç
Simple app for dance teachers to generate a dance sentence randomly from a set of selected action words. Could function equally well for anyone needing an interface for selecting n random elements from a set.

## Instructions
The app has a handful of default movement action words in a word bank at the bottom. Click those words to add them to the "bowl", or add custom words with the text input. Once your bowl has words in it, you'll be able to click a button to create a "dance sentence", using words selected from the bowl at random. Use the arrow buttons to add or remove all the words from the bowl at once. Click the "delete inactive words" button at the bottom of the screen to clear all words from the word bank (for instance, in case you'd like to create a word bank from scratch, or have students create their own).

The URL for the page updates with every change to the app. This means you can share the URL with students to send them to the app with the exact same word setup, or save it yourself to return to later.
